# Binary Addition 
Binary addition is like regular addition, but instead of using the numbers 0 through 9, it only uses 0 and 1. Think of it like counting with just two fingers! When you add two binary numbers, you follow these simple rules:

0 + 0 = 0 (nothing plus nothing is still nothing!)

0 + 1 = 1 (adding one to nothing gives you one)

1 + 0 = 1 (same as above)

1 + 1 = 10 (this is where it gets a little tricky—1 plus 1 equals 2, but since we only have 0s and 1s, we write it as "10," meaning 0 and carry over a 1 to the next column).

It’s just like how in regular addition, sometimes you carry over a number when the total is more than 9.

# Half Adders

A half adder is a simple machine used in computers to help them add two small numbers together, just like when you add numbers in math class. 
But instead of adding big numbers, a half adder only adds two tiny numbers, either 0 or 1.

Here’s how it works:

If both numbers are 0 (like two tails on coins), the sum is 0, and there’s no carry.

If one number is 0 and the other is 1 (like a heads and a tails), the sum is 1, and still no carry.

If one number is 1 and the other is 0 (like heads and tails), the sum is 1, and still no carry.

If both numbers are 1 (like two heads), the sum is 0, but now there’s a carry of 1 because the total becomes 2 (which is too big to fit in one place, so the extra goes to the carry).

# Physical demenstrations of simple Half Adders

In this diagram above we can see they used 220 ohms resistors but we decided to have one of those resitors be 320 ohms instead.

The half adder we talked about is like a tiny piece of the puzzle inside a machine like this. Just as gears turn to calculate numbers in the difference engine, the half adder handles small steps of adding 0s and 1s inside modern computers. Computers today may be much smaller, but they still rely on simple operations like the ones done by these early machines!
