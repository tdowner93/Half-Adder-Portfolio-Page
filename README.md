# Binary Addition 
Binary addition is like regular addition, but instead of using the numbers 0 through 9, it only uses 0 and 1. Think of it like counting with just two fingers! When you add two binary numbers, you follow these simple rules:

0 + 0 = 0 (nothing plus nothing is still nothing!)

0 + 1 = 1 (adding one to nothing gives you one)

1 + 0 = 1 (same as above)

1 + 1 = 10 (this is where it gets a little tricky—1 plus 1 equals 2, but since we only have 0s and 1s, we write it as "10," meaning 0 and carry over a 1 to the next column).

It’s just like how in regular addition, sometimes you carry over a number when the total is more than 9.
